Smart Button App:
This app is an expansion the of the helper app we created in Cambridge University Engineering Society Hackathon.
The app is about a button that connects to smart phone through low energy bluetooth, in which the user select many tasks in the phone and specify a time range for each task, when he/she presses the button within that time range the specific task should run in the phone.
Future improvements:
* Add a sign up feature so each user can make an account and manage the tasks online from any web browser.
* Extend the tasks to allow of IoT, where the user can have tasks that involve physical devices.
